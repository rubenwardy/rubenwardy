### Hi, I'm rubenwardy 👋

I’m a graduate from the University of Bristol and a core developer for [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/), an open source voxel game engine.

I have a diverse range of interests, both technical and non-technical.
Examples include [full-stack development](https://content.minetest.net/), [game dev](https://rubenwardy.com/rvwp/),
and [Android development](https://gitlab.com/rubenwardy/forummate).
I've recently been spending a lot of time learning how to cook new things 🍝🔥.

Note that I mostly use [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/rubenwardy/) these days.

Make sure to take a look at my [website](https://rubenwardy.com/), [blog](https://blog.rubenwardy.com), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rubenwardy)!
